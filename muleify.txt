Hey all I wrote a static site generator and I am looking for some constructive criticism or and feature suggestions. If anyone is interested in reviewing the project I would really appreciate it.

The project is called Muleify and it is hosted on Github and available on NPM. It is open source with MPL-2.0 incense.

I think it is rather unique since it requires almost zero configuration.
